Deploy instructions (Mac/Linux)
1. Install LAMP with the following command.
        sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php mariadb-server php

2. Set up mariadb with the following command:
        sudo mysql_secure_installation

3. Log-in to mariadb and create a user with the previleged access
        sudo mariadb

4. Create a new database user for the application.
        CREATE USER 'user_name'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

5. Grant your new user all the previleges. 
    Note this is not recommended for production but for the testing purpose only
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user_name'@'localhost';

6. Set your user name and password in the file src/setup/Credentials.php.
    
7. Move the file src/setup/Credentials.php to src/app/utils/Credentials.php
        cd ~/<project_directory>/src
        mv src/setup/Credentials.php src/app/utils/Credentials.php

8. Change directory to src/db
        cd ~/<project_directory>/src/db

9. Start the mariadb console and build the database.
        mariadb -p <your_password>
        #In console
        SOURCE master.sql
        #If you would like to populate the db with test data.
        SOURCE populate_all.sql 

10. Link the apache server directory with the application directory
        ln -s <project_directory>/src/app /var/www/

11. The application should be good to go! You can access the app on <your_id_of_server>/app/login.php
