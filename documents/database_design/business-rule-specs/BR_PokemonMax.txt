RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTED

  Type of participation:   _
  Degree of participation: X

ACTION TAKEN
To constrain this degree of participation
at the database level, we will have an 
active service records view and another 
view which aggregates pokemon per trainer
who have 2 pokemon in the care in active service 
records. From here, we impose an insertion rule,
where an insertion can only be made for a trainer
if that trainer is not in the aggregate for trainers
with max pokemon. 


NOTES: 
We can test this rule by 
creating a trainer and then
inserting two pokemon. 
Then a third pokemon will 
be inserted, but to no avail,
if test is incorrect.
