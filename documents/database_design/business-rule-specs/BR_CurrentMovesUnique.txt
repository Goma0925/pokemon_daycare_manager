ACTION TAKEN
When adding a new pokemon,
we keep a local list on the application
end and ensure that when they submit, 
there are no duplicates in the list. 
When updating existing moves, we pull those
moves in and update the new move, but check if
that new move overlaps with the other moves not
being replaced. 

NOTES: 
To test this, we just Insert
a new move associated with a particular
pokemon that results in a duplicate.
The db server will return a signal
saying failed.
