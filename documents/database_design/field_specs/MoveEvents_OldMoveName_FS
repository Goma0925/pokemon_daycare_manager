Description:          After the pokemon has learned 4 moves, that pokemon will have to 
					  forget a move and replace it with a new move.
					  We should be able to reconstruct a pokemon's moves so that we can 
					  present how we have helped the pokemon evolve over time. We will 
					  allow the trainer to rediscover their pokemon's past in this way.
