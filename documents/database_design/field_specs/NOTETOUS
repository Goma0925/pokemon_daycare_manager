NOTES TO US

There is a lot of inconsistent logging
because we are all new to using these kinds 
of specifications.

Let's talk to Bailey about things like
specifications for keys and using generics. 

There is extreme redundancy and if one thing changes,
so many other files have to change. 

This is kind of a problematic part of design because it 
can change, regardless how much one believes it will not.
